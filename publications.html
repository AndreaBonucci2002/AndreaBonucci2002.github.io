    <h2>
      Combinatorial aspects of surface Cluster algebras and applications to Frobenius' conjecture.
    </h2>
    <p class = "paragraph">
      <em>Abstract: </em>Since Frobenius stated his conjecture on the uniqueness of Markov triples in 1913, many have attempted to crack it; and in doing so uncovered essential knowledge about the conjecture. In this report, we seek to explore various techniques within Cluster algebra and utilize them in order to better understand the behaviour of Markov numbers. We use palindromification of continued fractions and connect them to the idea of snake graph to attain a reformulation of Frobenius’ conjecture in Cluster algebraic terms. Consequently, we apply Skein relations within the natural number lattice N × N to define left and right deformations around lattice points to provide a few result on the ordering of Markov numbers; and prove a conjecture posed by Aigner in [A].</p>

        Four Color Theorem
      </h2>
      <p class = "paragraph">
        <em>Abstract: </em>In 1852 Francis Guthrie was coloring in a map of the United Kingdom, when he noticed that to color in any map, he could use as little as four colors. This observation reached mathematician Augustus De Morgan, who in turn shared it with the mathematical world. The Four-Color Theorem emerged: a conjecture stating that to color in any figure with regions, where regions sharing a common boundary are colored differently, four colors would suffice...

        Frieze Patterns of Integers and Triangulated Polygons
      </h2>
      <p class = "paragraph">
        <em>Abstract: </em>This report seeks to examine finite frieze patterns of non negative integers, introduced in the early seventies by Coxeter. There are two primary aims of this paper. Firstly, it aims to prove the bijection between triangulations of convex n-gons and frieze patterns of order n discovered by Conway and Coxeter and discuss the construction of a frieze pattern from its associated convex polygon.

        Finitely generated modules over principal ideal domains
      </h2>
      <p class = "paragraph">
        <em>Abstract: </em>The purpose of this report is to give a detailed description about the structure and behaviour of finitely generated modules over principal ideal domains (PIDs), that are especially nice rings. This type of analysis is particularly important if we apply it to the ring of integers, ℤ, which is a PID; as it allows for a proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups.

        Mathematical Modeling of Stochastic Systems: <em>Forensic DNA</em>
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        <em>Abstract:</em> In this report we will focus on nuclear DNA, which is found in almost every cell of our body, subdivided into chromosomes. It is known that each of us has 23 pairs of chromosomes. One pair is indicative of our gender, i.e., men have one X-chromosome and one Y-chromosome, while women have two X-chromosomes.

        Mathematical Modelling of a Shock Absorber and Spring System
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        <em>Abstract:</em> Driving comfort and safety are essential considerations when behind the wheel. A shock absorber is typically used to keep the wheels in good contact with the road, absorbing and dampening any sudden motion. This project aims to develop a mathematical model of a shock absorber and draw conclusions regarding its optimal design.

        <em>Abstract:</em> As the number of endangered and extinct species continues to grow, it is becoming more and more important to understand how animals interact with each other in an ecosystem. Throughout this paper will explore how the populations of two species can change in density over time or under different experimental conditions...
