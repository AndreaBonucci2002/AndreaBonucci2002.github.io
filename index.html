  My name is Andrea, and I was born in Italy almost 21 years ago. I'm a third year mathematics bachelor student interested in the following:
   <ul>
    <li>rings and fields theory,</li>
    <li>Galois theory,</li>
    <li>hyperbolic geometry,</li>
    <li>algebraic combinatorics,</li>
    <li>algebraic number theory,</li>
    <li>Cluster algebras,</li>
    <li>quiver representation theory.</li>
  </ul> 
  Currently working on my bachelor thesis; which will be an examination of the combinatorial aspects of surface Cluster algebras, and connections to Frobenius' conjecture. I just finished working on a detailed Computer-Assisted proof report of the four color theorem; more precisely, the Dürre-Heesch D-reducibility algorithm involving
   2822 unavoidable configurations.

                <h3>Combinatorial aspects of surface cluster Algebras: An introduction</h3>
                <p>On February 24th 2023, I gave a quick introduction to my bachelor thesis; more precisely, combinatorial aspects of surface Cluster algebras and applications to Frobenius' conjecture. The main part of my talk was focused on explaining process of generating a Cluster algebra by using the triangulated puncture torus to construct a cluster quiver to then construct a cluster mutation that generates all Markov triples.</p>

          <em>Abstract:</em> Driving comfort and safety are essential considerations when behind the wheel. A shock absorber is typically used to keep the wheels in good contact with the road, absorbing and dampening any sudden motion. This project aims to develop a mathematical model of a shock absorber and draw conclusions regarding its optimal design.</p>

        <p><em>Abstract:</em> In this report we will focus on nuclear DNA, which is found in almost every cell of our body, subdivided into chromosomes. It is known that each of us has 23 pairs of chromosomes. One pair is indicative of our gender, i.e., men have one \(X\)-chromosome and one \(Y\)-chromosome, while women have two \(X\)-chromosomes. The remaining pairs of chromosomes are named autosomal. Autosomes are numbered generally in relation to their sizes. For example, Chromosome 1 has approximately 2,800 genes, and Chromosome 22 has 750 genes...</p>

          <p><em>Abstract: </em>The purpose of this report is to give a detailed description about the structure and behaviour of finitely generated modules over principal ideal domains (PIDs), that are especially nice rings. This type of analysis is particularly important if we apply it to the ring of integers, \(\mathbb{Z}\), which is a PID; as it allows for a proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups. We will describe an important concept called the Invariant Factor Form of a finitely generated module.
              We can then use the result as stated above and apply it in the special case of the PID \(F[x]\), i.e., the ring of polynomials in \(x\) with coefficients in the field \(F\). More precisely, when we use the Invariant Factor Decomposition of a finite dimensional vector space \(V\) over a field \(F\), i.e., \(V\) is an \(F[x]\)-module where \(x\) acts on \(V\) as a linear transformation \(T\), we obtain the Rational Canonical Form for the matrix for \(T\).</p>

        <p><em>Abstract: </em>
          This report seeks to examine finite frieze patterns of non negative integers, introduced in the early seventies by Coxeter. There are two primary aims of this paper. Firstly, it aims to prove the bijection between triangulations of convex \(n\)-gons and frieze patterns of order \(n\) discovered by Conway and Coxeter and discuss the construction of a frieze pattern from its associated convex polygon. Next, this paper seeks to use a connection to snake graphs to prove that every such frieze pattern must contain a four or consist entirely of Fibonacci numbers.</p>

        <em>Abstract:</em> In 1852 Francis Guthrie was coloring in a map of the United Kingdom, when he noticed that to color in any map, he could use as little as four colors. This observation reached mathematician Augustus De Morgan, who in turn shared it with the mathematical world. The Four-Color Theorem emerged: a conjecture stating that to color in any figure with regions, where regions sharing a common boundary are colored differently, four colors would suffice...</p>
