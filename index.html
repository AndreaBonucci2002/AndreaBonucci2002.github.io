My name is Andrea, and I was born in Italy almost 21 years ago. I'm a third year mathematics bachelor student interested in the following:
 <ul>
  <li>rings and fields theory,</li>
  <li>Galois theory,</li>
  <li>hyperbolic geometry,</li>
  <li>algebraic combinatorics,</li>
  <li>combinatorial geometry,</li>
  <li>algebraic number theory,</li>
  <li>quiver representation theory.</li>
</ul> 
Currently working on my bachelor thesis; which 
will be based on the Markov conjecture but from a cluster-algebraic point of view. I'm also working on a detailed Computer-Assisted proof report of the four color theorem; more precisely, the Dürre-Heesch D-reducibility algorithm involving 2822 unavoidable configurations.

        <em>Abstract:</em> Driving comfort and safety are essential considerations when behind the wheel. A shock absorber is typically used to keep the wheels in good contact with the road, absorbing and dampening any sudden motion. This project aims to develop a mathematical model of a shock absorber and draw conclusions regarding its optimal design.</p>

      <p><em>Abstract:</em> In this report we will focus on nuclear DNA, which is found in almost every cell of our body, subdivided into chromosomes. It is known that each of us has 23 pairs of chromosomes. One pair is indicative of our gender, i.e., men have one X-chromosome and one Y-chromosome, while women have two X-chromosomes. The remaining pairs of chromosomes are named autosomal. Autosomes are numbered generally in relation to their sizes. For example, Chromosome 1 has approximately 2,800 genes, and Chromosome 22 has 750 genes...</p>

    <h3>Finitely generated modules over

        <p><em>Abstract: </em>The purpose of this report is to give a detailed description about the structure and behaviour of finitely generated modules over principal ideal domains (PIDs), that are especially nice rings. This type of analysis is particularly important if we apply it to the ring of integers,Z, which is a PID; as it allows for a proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups. We will describe an important concept called the Invariant Factor Form of a finitely generated module.
            We can then use the result as stated above and apply it in the special case of the PID F[x], i.e., the ring of polynomials in x with coefficients in the field F. More precisely, when we use the Invariant Factor Decomposition of a finite dimensional vector space V over a field F, i.e., V is an F[x]-module where x acts on V as a linear transformation T, we obtain the Rational Canonical Form for the matrix for T.</p>

    <h3>Frieze Patterns of Integers and Triangulated Polygons</h3>

        <p><em>Abstract: </em>
          This report seeks to examine finite frieze patterns of non negative integers, introduced in the early seventies by Coxeter. There are two primary aims of this paper. Firstly, it aims to prove the bijection between triangulations of convex n-gons and frieze patterns of order n discovered by Conway and Coxeter and discuss the construction of a frieze pattern from its associated convex polygon. Next, this paper seeks to use a connection to snake graphs to prove that every such frieze pattern must contain a four or consist entirely of Fibonacci numbers.</p>
